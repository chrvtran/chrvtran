## About
Hello! My name is Christopher Tran. After obtaining my computer science degree, I enrolled in the Google UX Design certification program to upskill in the design sector of front-end development. Loving the work I did in product design, I decided to pivot my career to focus more on UI/UX design and research.

I have product design experience working with SaaS, AI, user testing, and a little bit of marketing. Those I worked with would describe me as having agency, attention to detail, organization, and insane Figma skills.

Let's create products that are clean and easy to use!
