## About
Hello everyone! My name is Christopher Tran. After obtaining my computer science degree, I enrolled in the Google UX Design certification program to upskill in the design sector of front-end development. I found great pride and satisfaction in my work as an outlet for being creative, collaborative, and engaging with users. As a result, I took a risk to pivot my career from software engineering to product design with ventures into SaaS marketing.

Let's create products that are stunning, fun, and easy to use!
