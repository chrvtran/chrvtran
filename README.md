## About
After obtaining my computer science degree, I enrolled in the Google UX Design program to upskill in the design sector of front-end development. While working on design projects, I found great pride and satisfaction in my work as an outlet for being creative, collaborative, and engaging with users. As a result, I pivoted my career from software engineering to product design. In my experiences, my peers described me as having agency, attention to detail, strong organizational skills, and an advanced command of Figma.

Let's create products that are stunning, fun, and easy to use!
